          <p class="p"><b>Ben 10 is an American media franchise created by Man of Action Studios and produced by Cartoon Network Studios. The series centers on a boy named Ben Tennyson who acquires the Omnitrix, an alien device resembling a wristwatch, which contains DNA of different alien species. Using the Omnitrix, Ben is able to transform into powerful aliens with various abilities. The Omnitrix initially contains ten aliens, although later on Ben obtains more species by adding their DNA.

            The Ben 10 franchise has received widespread critical acclaim, winning three Emmy Awards. It consists primarily of five television series and four films, the latter of which aired between August 2007 and March 2012. Spanning fifteen years, it is Cartoon Network's longest-running franchise to date. There is also a Ben 10 toy line manufactured by Bandai for the first four shows and Playmates Toys for the reboot. Worldwide, the franchise has grossed over $6 billion in retail sales.[3]
            
            On February 17, 2021, it was announced that three 44-minute specials based on the series would premiere in April 2021: titled Ben 10,010, Ben Gen 10 and Alien X-Tinction, serving as the series finale to the reboot and a crossover between the first five television series in the franchise.[4]</p>

        <p class="p">Not yet named in their debut theatrical short, Puss Gets the Boot (1940), Tom (the scheming cat) and Jerry (the spunky mouse) nonetheless were a hit with audiences. Animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera produced more than 100 episodes for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Several of these—including Yankee Doodle Mouse (1943), The Cat Concerto (1946), and Johann Mouse (1952)—won Academy Awards for best animated short subject. In most episodes Jerry foiled Tom’s efforts to catch him and lived to annoy him another day—though occasionally Tom got the upper hand, or the two would join forces against a common enemy. The series was driven entirely by action and visual humour; the characters almost never spoke. Tom and Jerry: The Movie premiered in 1992 in Europe and appeared on American screens the following year. In 2006 Warner Bros. debuted a new television series, Tom and Jerry Tales, which was closely modeled after the original theatrical shorts. Tom and Jerry (2021), a mix of live action and animation, was a surprise box office hit, grossing more than $100 million worldwide.</p>

        <p class="p">Jackie Chan Adventures is an American animated action comedy television series, created by John Rogers, Duane Capizzi and Jeff Kline, and produced by Sony Pictures Television (originally as Columbia TriStar Television for the first three seasons). The cartoon series premiered on September 9, 2000, and ran for five seasons until its conclusion on July 8, 2005. The series focuses on a fictionalized version of Hong Kong action film star Jackie Chan,[1][2] who operates in life as an archaeologist and special agent, combatting threats that are mainly magical and supernatural  – based on real-life mythologies and supernatural stories from Asia and around the world  – with the aid of his family and close friends.</p><br>

    <p class="p">Doraemon is a fictional character in the Japanese manga and anime series of the same name created by Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of writing team Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. He is a male robotic cat that travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a preteen boy named Nobita. An "official" birth certificate for the character gives him a birth date of 3 September 2112 and lists his city of residency as Kawasaki, Kanagawa, the city where the manga was created. In 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon the country's "anime ambassador".</p>
